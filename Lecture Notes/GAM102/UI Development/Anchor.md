- A UI GameObject will have a different Transform component. You will find at the top of the GameObject for your TMP text a Rect Transform.
- In the top left corner is what looks like a box with a crosshair in it.
- Click on the box to open the Anchor Presets menu.
- An anchor is made up of 4 points.
- These 4 points help decide the relative position of a UI object to its parent.
- We can set the anchor position using the buttons with yellow dots.
- #### Moving Components
	- You can use the Shift and Alt key to set the pivot or position of the element you are anchoring when using the [[Anchor]] Presets menu.
	- We can also set the Pivot of the UI object. 
	- The Pivot of an object is the position from where it scales and rotates from. 
	- By default, it is set to the centre of the object.
	- Another part of the position is the Stretch option in this menu.
		- This will stretch the object in the direction of the button you select.
