The best way to edit UI components is to view the canvas in the 2D setting in Unity.
### Canvas Components
- Render Mode
	- Screen Space Overlay: Renders the UI over the screen.
	- Screen Space Camera: Renders the UI to one selected camera.
	- World Space: Renders the UI in world space.
- Canvas Scaler:
	- Constant Pixel Size: Makes UI elements retain the same size in pixels regardless of screen size.
	- Scale With Screen Size: Makes UI elements bigger the bigger the screen is.
	- Constant Physical Size: Makes UI elements retain the same physical size regardless of screen size and resolution.
